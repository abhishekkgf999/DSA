You've got it! These are the three main types of knapsack problems used in optimization and dynamic programming:

1. **0/1 Knapsack** – You either take an item or leave it; no partial selection is allowed. This is commonly solved using 
recursion with memoization or dynamic programming.

2. **Fractional Knapsack** – Unlike the 0/1 variant, you can take fractions of an item. This is efficiently solved using a 
greedy algorithm, where items are chosen based on their value-to-weight ratio.

3. **Unbounded Knapsack** – Items can be taken multiple times (unlimited supply). This is typically solved using dynamic 
programming approaches like bottom-up DP with a single array.
